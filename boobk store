To complete the Online Bookstore project efficiently and with high quality under a time constraint, we'll streamline the features and optimize the workflow. Here's how we'll approach it:

Optimized Requirements for the Online Bookstore:
Key Features:
Homepage:

Display a list of books with titles, authors, and prices.
Search bar to filter books by title.
Book Details Page:

Clicking on a book shows detailed information (author, price, description).
"Add to Cart" button.
Cart Page:

List of selected books.
Total price calculation.
"Checkout" button (no payment integration, just a confirmation message).
Backend API:

Endpoints for fetching books, adding to cart, and retrieving cart details.
Formal UI:

Use a blue palette with shades of blue and white for a professional look.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js (for faster UI development and responsiveness).
Backend: Node.js with Express.js.
Database: JSON file (to save time) instead of a full-fledged database.
Styling: CSS with a blue-themed palette.
Development Plan:
Day 1: Setup and Homepage
Set up the project structure for frontend and backend.
Create a responsive homepage to list books.
Implement a search bar.
Day 2: Book Details Page
Build the book details page.
Add functionality to "Add to Cart."
Day 3: Cart Page
Create the cart page with total price calculation.
Implement the "Checkout" button with a confirmation message.
Day 4: Backend API
Create endpoints for fetching books and managing the cart.
Connect the frontend to the backend.
Day 5: Final Touches
Style the application using the blue palette.
Test all functionalities and fix any bugs.
UI Design - Blue Palette
Primary Blue: #1E90FF (Dodger Blue).
Secondary Blue: #4682B4 (Steel Blue).
Background: #F0F8FF (Alice Blue).
Text: #00008B (Dark Blue).
Next Steps:
Let’s start with setting up the project structure and building the homepage. I’ll share the progress and code snippets step by step.

Online Bookstore
The initial setup for the Online Bookstore is complete:

Backend: A Node.js server is running with a sample /books endpoint to provide book data.
Frontend: A React.js application fetches and displays the book list with a formal blue-themed UI.
Next steps:

Enhance the UI with a search bar and style refinements.
Add functionality for the book details page.
Let me know if you'd like to proceed with these enhancements!

Edited
The file structure has been added to the project setup for better organization. It now includes clear distinctions between backend and frontend components, along with their respective files and directories. Let me know if you need further refinements or additional functionality!
